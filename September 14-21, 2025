# SOC-Journal - Entry 002: Week in Review
> *Self-paced cybersecurity bootcamp journal - documenting, lessons, and growth.*
*Date Logged:** September 21, 2025
**Platform:** TryHackMe - *Pre_Security Path* ,Google Cybersecurity Certification Foundations of Cybersecurity*
**Rooms:**
Intro to LAN
OSI Model
Packets and Frames
Extending Your Network
DNS in Detail
HTTP in Detail
How Websites Work
Putting It All Together
In Progress: Linux Fundamentals Part 1

## Reflections & Takeaways
Gained a clearer understanding of **network communication** through the OSI model and how protocols like DNS and HTTP work together.
Realized the importance of **packet structure** in data transfer and how these fundamentals apply to real-world SOC anaylsis.
The **Google modules helped contextualize** the technical skills with real-world job functions and terminology.
Practiced using **TryHackMe** walkthroughs** to reinforce theoretical knowledge with interactive labs.

### Questions I Still Have:
Where can I get **more hands-on Linux command practice** outside of TryHackMe?
How can I simulate real SOC tasks involving:
DNS analysis
HTTP traffic investigation
Packet capture & inspection

## Next Week's Goals
Finish Linux Fundamental Part 1
Start Linux Fundamentals Part 2 and 3
Begin building repeatable note-taking format or flashcard system for Linus CLI commands
Complete Module 4 on Google Cybersecurity Certification
