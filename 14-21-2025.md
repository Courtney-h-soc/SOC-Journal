## Reflections

This week helped solidify my understanding of how networks function at different layers. TryHackMe rooms gave a structured look into protocols like DNS and HTTP, while the Google Certificate provided a broader context for security roles and responsibilities. Starting the Linux labs showed me how important command line comfort will be going forward.

## Questions I Still Have

- Where can I get more hands-on Linux command practice outside of TryHackMe?  
- How can I simulate real SOC tasks like DNS analysis or log triage?  
- What tools are beginner-friendly for packet inspection and HTTP traffic capture?

## Next Week’s Goals

- Complete Linux Fundamentals Part 1  
- Begin Linux Fundamentals Part 2 and 3  
- Create CLI notes or flashcards  
- Begin looking into basic SOC workflows (ticketing systems, alerts, triage examples)
