# SOC-Journal - Entry 001: What is Networking?
> *Self-paced cybersecurity bootcamp journal - documenting the journey, lessons, and gorwth.*
**Date Logged:** September 4, 2025

**Module:** What is Networking?



### Key Concepts I learned:
A computer network is a group of devices that communicate using set rules called protocols.
Data travels across networks in small pieces called packets.
IP addresses help devices identify each other on a network.
The internet is a network of networks - and routers help direct traffic.
I learned about the roles of clients and servers in everyday use, like how a browser (client) requests a webpage from a server.



### Reflections: 
This module helped demystify how the interner actually works. I've used the internet all my life, but never really understood what happens when I type a web address or use an app.



### Questions I Still Have:
What tools are used to **see packets in action**?
How do attackers manipulate this network flow?
What does it mean to "sniff" traffic - and how is that used ethically in cybersecurity?



### Next Steps:
Explore the next module: *Introduction to LAN*
I will look up videos or articles on how professionals analyze network traffic and learn what specific skill or practice is called.
Keep journaling what I learn - no matter how small it seems.
